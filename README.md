# covid19_global-tracker

## Project Description
This project is a COVID-19 Global Data Tracker that uses Python and Jupyter Notebook to analyze and visualize the spread of COVID-19 worldwide. It focuses on trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries across different countries over time, allowing users to explore the pandemic’s progression with data visualizations.

## Objectives
- To Import and clean COVID-19 global data from a CSV file or online source.
- To Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the spread of the virus.
- To Visualize COVID-19 trends using graphs (line plots, bar charts, heatmaps).
- To Compare COVID-19 statistics across countries and regions.
- To Gain insights into which regions were most affected during different periods.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python 3.11.9** – main programming language
- **Pandas** – data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** – numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** – data visualization
- **Seaborn** – enhanced data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – interactive development environment
